While J.D. Kelleher and Tierney, (2018) viewed ML as a field of computer science that focuses developing and evaluating algorithms that can extract useful patterns from datasets. Therefore, the accuracy of the ML model can be improved by continuing collecting new data and feed into the model.</description></item><item><title>Programmer Digest 1</title><link>https://lauyh.github.io/posts/programmer-digest-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2022 16:02:18 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://lauyh.github.io/posts/programmer-digest-1/</guid><description>This is a post regarding the summary of

New software developers tend to either care about theory or to completely ignore it. You’ll find a middle point eventually, but achieving that can be accel- erated with a certain perspective.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://lauyh.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lauyh.github.io/about/</guid><description>I am Richard, currently working as a Software Developer in a Software House company. The daily task that I working on is designing and implementing the algorithm based on the new requirement and do the testing to ensure the algorithm is working correctly.
