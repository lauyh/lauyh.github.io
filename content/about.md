 I am Richard, currently working as a Software Developer in a Software House company.
 The daily task that I working on is designing and implementing the algorithm based on the 
 new requirement and do the testing to ensure the algorithm is working correctly.
 The technology stack that I working on are NodeJS, ReactJS, and MySQL.

 I am passionate to explore new technologies and get the hand dirty on trying the new stuff.
